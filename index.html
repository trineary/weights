<p><img src="images/GeneralMarketShot.png" alt="S&amp;P 500 Index"><div class="caption">S&P 500 Index</div></p>

<p>The stock market provides the opportunity for individual investors to buy into corporations that they believe have value and will increase in value over time.  Additionally it provides a means for corporations to generate revenue for their needs.  There are many different ways of gauging a corporations value, so the market provides opportunities for people to buy and sell shares of corporations stock according to their beliefs about the value of that company.  Some people buy and sell stocks based on economic fundamentals, some base decisions on technical analysis, and others base decisions on other factors.  </p>

<p>The use of computer algorithms to make trading decisions has increased over time. Large banks and other institutions employ algorithms for trading and issuing trade signals from these programs.  They take advantage of market movement for generating profit.</p>

<p>Individual investors are also able to participate in the buying and selling of stocks.  There are a multitude of providers that allow individuals to buys and sell stocks and employ their investment strategies.  Some of these providers enable the use of programmatic buying and selling of stocks.  This opens up the playing field of algorithmic trading to anyone interested.  </p>

<p>Artificial Intelligence provides many different tools for solving complex problems.   This project is focused applying Neural Networks to learn, identify, and act upon patterns discovered in the stock market to automate trades.  The goal is to have a trading algorithm that will match the historical average return of the stock market through all market conditions.  </p>

<h3>
<a id="what-this-project-is" class="anchor" href="#what-this-project-is" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What this Project is</h3>

<p>This project employs the use of AI algorithms, Neural Networks specifically, for identifying patterns in the stock market and entering and exiting positions based on those trends.  </p>

<p>One method of interpreting sentiment and predicting future market action in the stock market is using candlestick patterns.  Candlesticks were first used by Japanese rice traders.  The theory behind candlesticks is that they capture, in real time, the current sentiment and beliefs of all market participants.  </p>

<p>This paper looks at marrying candlestick patterns with Neural Networks to identify patterns resulting in profitable trades.
Coding for this project is done in Python in the Quantopian environment.  Quantopian provides a platform for developing trading algorithms, back testing those algorithms, and comparing algorithmic results against market performance.  </p>

<h3>
<a id="why-is-this-project-important" class="anchor" href="#why-is-this-project-important" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why is this Project Important?</h3>

<p>Developing the ability to employ trading algorithms is important for the investor that wants to take control of a portion of their own portfolio.  This is especially true if the developed algorithm is able to identify and take advantage of short positions.  If one looks back to the stock market crash in 2008-2009, many portfolios lost a significant amount of money during those months.  If one had developed an algorithm that was able to identify and take advantage of short opportunities, however, that portfolio could have actually increased in value or at least maintained its value during the crash as opposed to losing a significant portion of its value.</p>

<p>This project is important for this very reason.  To allow a portfolio to take advantage of all market conditions and to protect, at least a portion of, one's retirement.  If another market crash was to take place, I would prefer to have means in place to protect what has been earned through hard work.  In my mind, this is an extremely motivating reason to pursue and find a successful trading algorithm.  </p>
